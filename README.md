# Performance-Analysis-of-YOLOv7-and-YOLOv8-Models-for-Drone-Detection
This study compares between the two widely used deep-learning models, previously used YOLOv7 and the latest YOLOv8. We got the result that for 10 epochs YOLOv8 gave 50.16% accuracy while YOLOv7 gave 48.16% accuracy making YOLOv8 more promising for the task.
